# VJS: Voice-Driven Job Search Assistant üöÄ  

### What if you could search for a job with just a voice prompt?  

Welcome to **VJS (Voice Job Search)**, an AI-powered concept app that transforms your job-hunting experience. Speak your job preferences, and VJS will handle the rest‚Äîscouring LinkedIn, analyzing matches against your profile, and even narrating the results with a voice that embodies confidence and excitement (or whatever tone fits the outcome!).  

### üîç How Does It Work?  

1. **Speak Your Search**  
   Simply give a voice command like:  
   > *"Find me software engineer jobs in New York"*  

2. **AI Takes Charge**  
   - **Transcription**: Your voice is transcribed using the Whisper model.  
   - **Job Title Validation**: Our Ollama model checks for a valid job title and confirms it.  
   - **Search Automation**: Once validated, VJS logs into LinkedIn and performs a job search.  

3. **Find the Perfect Match**  
   - **Resume Matching**: VJS compares job results to your profile/resume using AI filtering.  
   - **Prioritized Results**: Jobs are categorized into ‚ÄúBest Fit‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlternatives.‚Äù  

4. **Hear the Outcome**  
   - Using the **Suno/Bark model**, VJS generates a vocalized summary of the results, with tone and emotion tailored to the findings.  
   - Results are printed alongside clickable job URLs for easy access.
